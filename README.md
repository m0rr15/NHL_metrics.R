# NHL_metrics.R
My work on data from the National Hockey League (NHL). The repository contains the following scripts:
* compileall.R: would scrape all the data at once. Due to sheer amount of data (it was 2014) I had to switch to 
* compileseasons.R: scrapes data season-by-season. This runs smoothly and scrapes succesfully the desired data
* descriptive1314.R: Data cleaning and tidying, exploratory analysis and visualizations
* ppossession.R: What makes teams win? Comparison of puck possession proxies
* truescorers1314.R: Idea: There are more important goals than others. Time for an augmented Maurice "Rocket" Richard Trophy
* 2ndaryscoring2.R:  Is ice hockey a strong-link or a weak-link game? And how important is secondary scoring really? These questions are tackled in this script where I propose a new measurement of secondary scoring based on the Gini-coefficient in Economics
